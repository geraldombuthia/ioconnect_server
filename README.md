# IOconnecT
This is an IoT web platform that provides endpoints to receive, store and present data from iot devices.
It is  built using nodejs, express, and mongodb for the backend.

## Objectives

### Short Term/ Development objectives
- Receive data from an IoT device.
- Process data received.
- Store data received in a database.
- Ability to retrieve this data and present it to a user
- Fast response during operation

### Long Term objectives
- Expand this to a platform that is reliable for use by developers
- Provide a comprehensive developer ecosystem that takes care of the full development and operation cycle
- Provide an end-user control interfaces such as web applications that can provide more access to the systems
- Provide data handling capabilities and acquisition of insights from said data.


## Architecture and Design
This platform will utilise a Rest API to provide a data transfer medium.
A front-end interface will be designed to display this data to user and allow the user to provide response
in regards to control and settings.

## Targeted USERS
This is ideally targeted to IoT developers who don't have the necessary skills to build a fully fledged IoT platform.
It will streamline the development process and allow for quick development cycles.
